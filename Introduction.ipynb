However, most of these websites provides recommendation simply based on usual tourist attractions or key residential areas that are mostly expensive or already known for travelers based on certain keywords like \"Hotel\", or \"Backpackers\" etc. The intention on this project is to collect and provide a data driven recommendation that can supplement the recommendation with statistical data. This will also be utilizing data retrieved from Singapore open data sources and FourSquare API venue recommendations.\n"
